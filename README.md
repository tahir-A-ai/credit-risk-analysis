# Credit Risk Analysis Project

Hey there! Welcome to my Credit Risk Analysis project. This is a comprehensive machine learning solution designed to help financial institutions assess customer creditworthiness and identify high-risk applicants before extending credit.

## What's This All About?

Ever wondered how banks decide whether to approve your loan? Behind the scenes, they're using systems very similar to this one! This project builds a machine learning model that analyzes customer data to predict the likelihood of defaulting on a loan.

## The Problem We're Solving

Financial institutions face a constant challenge: they want to approve as many loans as possible (that's how they make money!), but every default costs them significantly. Our solution helps strike the perfect balance by:

- Identifying high-risk customers who are likely to default
- Reducing overall default rates
- Providing clear risk categories for decision-making
- Quantifying the financial benefit of using the model

## What's Inside This Project

### Data Exploration
We start by really getting to know our data - understanding distributions, identifying missing values, and spotting patterns that might help with prediction.

### Data Preprocessing
Financial data is rarely perfect! We handle missing values, deal with outliers, and transform features to get everything ready for modeling.

### Feature Engineering
We create powerful new features related to income, debt ratios, and repayment history that help our models better understand credit risk patterns.

### Class Imbalance Handling
Default events are (thankfully) rare, which creates a challenge for machine learning. We use SMOTE to generate synthetic examples of the minority class.

### Multiple Models
We train and compare three powerful algorithms:
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost

### Business Impact Analysis
Beyond just technical metrics, we analyze how the model would impact the business by estimating default reduction and conducting cost-benefit analysis.

### Production-Ready System
The final product is a complete system ready for deployment, including preprocessing pipeline, optimized thresholds, and a risk scoring function.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. All other dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tahir-A-ai/credit-risk-analysis.git
cd credit-risk-analysis
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Download the dataset
The project uses the "Give Me Some Credit" dataset, which you can download from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/GiveMeSomeCredit/data

5. Run the notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook Credit_Risk_Analysis_Project.ipynb
```

## Results & Insights

After training and evaluating multiple models, we were able to:

- Identify the most important features for predicting default risk
- Reduce the expected default rate by flagging high-risk customers
- Demonstrate significant cost savings through better risk assessment

The top predictive features turned out to be revolving utilization of unsecured lines, debt ratio, and past delinquency history - which aligns nicely with financial domain knowledge!

## Next Steps

This project is just the beginning. Here's what could come next:

- Deploying the model as a web service with an easy-to-use interface
- Implementing A/B testing to validate business impact
- Adding model explainability features to help users understand specific predictions
- Developing monitoring systems to catch model drift over time
